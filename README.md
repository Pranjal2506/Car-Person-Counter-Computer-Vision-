# AI-Powered Real-Time Vehicle & Pedestrian Counting System.

This project leverages computer vision and deep learning to count the number of cars and people in live CCTV footage. It provides valuable insights for traffic management, enabling authorities to optimize signal timings and reduce congestion. Additionally, it aids in crowd management by helping businesses monitor foot traffic, enhancing safety and operational efficiency in public spaces. The system operates in real time, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution for smart city initiatives and commercial applications.
